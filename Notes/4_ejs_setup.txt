In this lecture we will learn about how to setup our app to use ejs concept:- 

1. create folders in the views folder as per of the views.
i.e. admin, customer

2. and create more folders to make life easy to work with the file according to their functionality.
i.e. auth, cart, products

3. open terminal and install ejs package.

4. in app.js we need to activate this package. 
=> like we telling app.js that we will use ejs to render the html pages.

5. we need to set two options in our app object:- 
app.set("view engine","ejs); // we are setting "view engine" option to "ejs"
app.set("view",path.join(__dirname, "views", "customer", "auth")); // we are telling type and path folder where files lies.

6. now we can use ejs templates files as html files.
7. goto views folders and write ejs files.
i.e. in auth folder we can write login.ejs and signup.ejs files.
